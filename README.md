# collab
code for cisco collab
This python code should be run on Ingress and VXML gateways for Contact center 10.X, 11.X and 12.0 version. These are best practice commands on the gateways. One of the references is built into the code but may not be there in the future.
The output file is sent to C:/python, you can change the location to whatever it allowed.
The script can test multiple gateways, it is set to only 1 at the moment. Change gws to list all the gateways you want tested and uncomment them.
